            "correct": "<strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</strong>All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and objects are automatically encrypted by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\n This encryption setting applies to all objects in your Amazon S3 buckets.\n<strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong>AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.\n All data transferred between the gateway and AWS storage is encrypted using SSL (for all three types of gateways - File, Volume and Tape Gateways).\n",
            "incorrect": "<strong>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</strong> - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes are not encrypted, by default.\n You can configure your AWS account to enforce the encryption of the new EBS volumes and snapshot copies that you create.\n<strong>Amazon Redshift</strong> - Encryption is an optional setting in Amazon Redshift.\n When you enable encryption for a cluster, the data-blocks and system metadata are encrypted for the cluster and its snapshots.\n<strong>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)</strong> - Encryption is not a default setting, but an optional configuration for Amazon EFS drives.\n Amazon EFS supports two forms of encryption for file systems, encryption of data in transit and encryption at rest.\nReferences:",
